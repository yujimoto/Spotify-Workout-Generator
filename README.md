# Spotify-Workout-Generator
A webapp that will use your playlist and generate a new workout playlist based on the bpm of the song (and other metrics) etc etc etc etc. **NOT DONE YET***
## How to run this webapp
cd into both /frotnend and /backend then npm install to install all depdencies. Then run npm run dev in both the frontend and backend directories. Also note that you will need to obtain a Spotify API Key through their developer's website. Also add your own port in the env file or directly in the code.
### What was used to build this?
Frontend is built using Vite (reactjs) with bootstrap components (navbar etc) for responsiveness. Backend is expressJs.
